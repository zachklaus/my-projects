- LoadTables.sql: loads the database with the .dump data files found in the "data" folder
- NukeTables.sql: deletes the tables and view of the database
- NukeTriggers.sql: deletes the triggers of the database
- QueryTables.sql: examples of queries against the database
- QueryView.sql: queries the view of the database
- refresh.sql: deletes, re-creates, and re-loads the database
- Files in "test" are used to test the triggers created from CreateTriggers.sql
