# Graphs

- In this project I implemented some common graph algorithms using Python.
- PQ.py implements a min priority queue using a min heap.
- UF.py implements union find.
- WGraph.py reads and stores a graph contained in graph.txt. It contains the function Kruskal() which uses union find contained in UF.py to implement Kruskal's algorithm. WGraph.py also contains the function Prim() which uses the priority queue contained in PQ.py to implement Prim's algorithm.
- Kruskal() and Prim() are used on the graph read from graph.txt.
