# Propositional Logic

- This project implements some concepts of propositional logic using Python.
- PropositionalLogic.py contains functions that do this.
- Tester.py contains some assertions to test the functions in PropositionalLogic.py.
- I implemented truth_table(), count_satisfying(), is_tautology(), are_equivalent(), and get_result_list() in PropositionalLogic.py as well as some tests in Tester.py.
