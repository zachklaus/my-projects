# Expression Tree

- In this project I was tasked with implementing an expression tree to solve mathematical expressions in string format.
- ExpressionTree.java: inherits from the abstract class AbstractTree. Contains the code for parsing an expression string, building a tree out of the resulting tokens, and using the tree to evaluate the expression.
- AbstractTree.java: contains methods that ExpressionTree can use as well as signatures of methods for ExpressionTree to implement.
- TestCode.java: used to test ExpressionTree.java.
- I implemented most of ExpressionTree.java and was provided TestCode.java and AbstractTree.java.
