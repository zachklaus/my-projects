# CoolQueue

- In this project I was tasked with implementing an interface known as QueueInterface.
- CoolQueue is the class that was created to implement the interface and it functions as a basic queue data structure.
- I implemented CoolQueue.java and was provided QueueInterface.java and TestProgram.java.
