# Card Game Sim

- This is a project I was working on to create some kind of card game simulation where two AI opponents are dealt a randomly shuffled deck of cards and play the game of "War" against eachother.
- It is not finished.
- Card.java is a class to represent the cards in the deck.
- Main.java builds and shuffles the deck of cards and deals them to the AI players.
