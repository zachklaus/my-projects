# Hashing

- This project implements several different hashing algorithms as well as a hash table.
- Hasher.java: file where several differnt hashing algorithms are implemented.
- HashTable.java: implementation of a hash table.
- HashInterface.java: interface for HashTable.java.
- Debug.java: file to be used for debugging source code.
- Shell.java: adds the ability to get commands from the user for performing different program functions.
- TestCode.java: used to test Hasher.java and HashTable.java.
- I implemented most of Hasher.java and HashTable.java and was provided Debug.java, HashInterface.java, Shell.java, and I believe TestCode.java although I may have implemented some of TestCode.java as well.
