# Graphs

- This project implements a graph data structure representing cities and the distances between them.
- In this instance, the cities are the nodes and the distances between them are the edges.
- The purpose of the project was to gain experience with graphs and graph algorithms.
- GraphAbstract.java: Abstract parent class of GraphImplementation. Contains inner classes GraphEdge and GraphNode, GraphEdge and GraphNode ArrayLists representing the contents of the graph, and various abstract methods to be implemented by GraphImplementation.
- GraphImplementation.java: implements several abstract methods contained in GraphAbstract.java for reading and writing graphs to/from files, the depth first search (DFS) algorithm, breadth first search (BFS) algorithm, and the shortest path algorithm.
- I implemented most of GraphImplementation.java and was provided GraphAbstract.java.
