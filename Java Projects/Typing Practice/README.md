# Typing Practice

- This is a program I made that will help the user practice typing.
- The user can choose if they want to practice typing text, symbols, or numbers as well as how many lines they would like to practice with (only the "text" option has been implemented).
- Words are read from "words.txt" and "words2.txt" and are randomly given to the user to practice with.
- The program checks if the user correctly typed the text and will prompt them to try again if not.
