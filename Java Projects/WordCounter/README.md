# Word Counter

- The goal of this program was to write a large number of random characters to the file CharacterBlock.
- The user would then provide a word.
- From there the program would read through the file of characters and count how many times the provided word was in the block by comparing sequences of characters in the character file to the desired word.
- The program also checks that the user provided word is a valid english word by comparing it to the words contained in wordEn.txt.
- So far getting the user input, generating the character file, and verifying the user input have been implemented.
