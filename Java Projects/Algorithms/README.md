# Algorithms

- In this project I was tasked with implementing several common searching and sorting algorithms from an Interface.
- TestProgram would then using Timing in order to performance test my implementations.
- I was provided Interface.java, TestProgram.java, and Timing.java and I implemented Algorithms.java.
