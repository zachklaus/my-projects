# ProcessGrades

- The purpose of this project was to practice file I/O, using data structures, and implementing interfaces with Java.
- ProcessGrades.java reads a roster file (roster.csv) and corresponding grade values file (grades.csv) and uses this data to compute various statistics which are writted to an output file (upload.csv).
- Interface.java is the interface that is implemented by ProcessGrades.java.
- TestCode.java contains the main() method as well as various tests for ProcessGrades.
- I was given Interface.java as well as some code in TestCode.java and was tasked with implementing almost all of ProcessGrades.java as well as some of TestCode.java.
