- This project contains the implementations of the Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort sorting algorithms.
- I was tasked with implementing the merge sort and quick sort algorithms in MergeSort.java and QuickSort.java respectively.
- I was provided with BubbleSort.java and SortTest.java.
- BubbleSort.java: contains the implementation of the Bubble Sort sorting algorithm.
- MergeSort.java: contains the implementation of the Merge Sort sorting algorithm.
- QuickSort.java: contains the implementation of the Quick Sort sorting algorithm.
- SortTest.java: used for testing MergeSort.java and QuickSort.java.
