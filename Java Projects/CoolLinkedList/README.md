# Cool Linked List

- In this project I was tasked with implementing my own version of the Linked List data structure.
- I implemented CoolLinkedList.java as well as MyTest.java and was provided Debug.java, LinkedListInterface.java, ListInterface.java, and TrainCar.java.
- ListInterface.java: interface used for implementing different types of list data structures.
- LinkedListInterface.java: interface used for implementing linked list data structures. Extends ListInterface.java.
- CoolLinkedList.java: implements LinkedListInterface.java and functions as a linked list data structure.
- Debug.java: can be used to debug source files.
- TrainCar.java: can be used to created linked lists of TrainCar objects for testing CoolLinkedList.java.
- MyTest.java: used for testing CoolLinkedList.java.
