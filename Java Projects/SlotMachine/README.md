# Slot Machine

- This is a basic command line slot machine game.
- The user starts out with 10 coins and can bet however many coins they want in a round as long as they have enough coins.
- For the round, 5 words are displayed to the console (WIN or LOSE).
- If the number of WIN words is >= 3, then the player gets 2x their bet in coins.
- If the number of WIN words is < 3, then the player loses their bet.
- The game keeps playing rounds until the player loses all of their coins or the player chooses not to keep playing.
