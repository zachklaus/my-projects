# Towers of Hanoi

- This is a project for displaying the Towers of Hanoi puzzle in a GUI and solving it using stack data structures.
- I implemented CoolStack.java as well as most of TowersOfHanoi.java.
- StackInterface.java: interface for CoolStack.java.
- CoolStack.java: implements StackInterface.java and functions as a stack data structure.
- StdDraw.java: library used by UserInterface.java to display the Towers of Hanoi GUI.
- TowersOfHanoi.java: uses CoolStack.java and implements logic to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.
