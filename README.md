# My Projects

Hello!

This repository contains coding projects I have created/worked on. Many are from my time in school but some are things I have worked on in my personal time for fun.

I have created this repository to document and archive some of my experience in programming and software development.

If you have any questions, please email me at zachklausner@gmail.com.

Thank you,

Zachary Klausner
