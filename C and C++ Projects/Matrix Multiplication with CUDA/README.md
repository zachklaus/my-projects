# Matrix Multiplication with CUDA

- The objective of this project was to implement parallelized matrix multiplication using CUDA.
- I developed the majority of the code found in matmultKernel01.cu which is the CUDA kernel that is executed by the GPU.
- The majority of the other source code was provided to me and is the host CPU code.
