# Web Server Vulnerability Analysis

- In this project I was given a hypothetical scenario in which I was
tasked with examining the source code of a web server and identifying a vulnerability
that led to an unauthorized user gaining access.
- The analyzed source code lies in fhttpd/server/webserver.c
- exploit1_memo.txt contains an explanation of the discovered vulnerability
- exploit1.sh uses payload1 to demonstrate the vulnerability
