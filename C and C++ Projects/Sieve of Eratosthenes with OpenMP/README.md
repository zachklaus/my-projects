# Sieve of Eratosthenes with OpenMP

- This project contains a series of versions of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding prime numbers up to a limit.
- I was given sieve.c (the sequential version) and implemented sieve1.c - sieve4.c.
- Each version of sieve is progressively more optimized and parallelized with OpenMP for better performance.
