# Process Scheduling

- In this project I implemented two process scheduling algorithms in C that serve to mimic what an operating system might use to allocate processor resources.
- scheduling.c contains SJF_non_pre() and FCFS()
- SJF_non_pre() implements the Shortest Job First (non preemptive) scheduling algorithm.
- FCFS() implements the First Come First Serve scheduling algorithm.
- Processes are modelled as structs.
