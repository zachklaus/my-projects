# Circuit Satisfiability with MPI

- This project demonstrates how MPI (Message Passing Interface) can be used to make a sequential program parallel across more than one computer.
- The program uses MPI to divide the work of checking which inputs make the output of the given circuit (in sat.c) True.
- I was given most of the source code and used MPI to make it parallel.
