# Client-Server Communication Formats
## Version 1

This file will specify the standard format for data exchanged and stored between systems of the software. These formats will be used in the following system interactions:

* Clients to Server
* Server to Clients

The format for all data to be exchanged will be that of JSON objects (https://www.json.org/). This means that whenever clients and the server exchange information a JSON object will be sent with the required information. 

This document will be updated throughout the duration of the project as needed. Objects will be removed and added over the course of development.

There will be three types of objects sent between clients and the server. These will be `Update`, `Action`, and `ServerError`. Each of the four objects will have different purposes depending on which properties of the object are filled in or what values are filled in for those properties. 

Clients will send `Action` objects.
The server will send `Update` and `ServerError` objects.

An `Action` object will be sent by a client whenever a player wants to perform an action such as registering, logging in, inviting another player, moving a piece on the board, etc...

An `Update` object will be sent by the server whenever the server is responding to a client's action. These are things like updating the Game board, sending the client their acount information, etc...

A  `ServerError` object will be sent by the server whenever there is an error on the server side. These are things like the player attempted to perform an invalid set of moves, the login information was incorrect, etc...

Here is the structure for each of the four objects:

## Action

```javascript
{
  "objectType": "Action",
  "communicationType": "requestMoves",
  "communicationVersion": 1,
  "matchID": "",
  "playerName": "",
  "pieceID": "Z",
  "desiredMoves": [],
  "userName": "",
  "userPassword": "",
  "userEmail": "",
  "playerOneName": "",
  "playerTwoName": "",
  "invitationFrom": "",
  "invitationTo": "",
  "invitationTime": "",
  "playerQuitting": ""
}
```

## Update

```javascript
{
  "objectType": "Update",
  "communicationType": "updateBoard",
  "communicationVersion": 1,
  "matchID": "",
  "playerName": "",
  "pieceID": "m",
  "updatedBoard": [][],

}
```
## ServerError

```javascript
{
  "objectType":"ServerError",

  "errorMessage": "Invalid password"
}
```
`objectType` is the type of communication object being sent (ServerError).
`errorCode` is the code for the type of error that occurred.
`errorMessage` is a message detailing the error that occurred.

List of error codes:

* 100 = Invalid password when attempting a login

List of communication types for `ServerError`:

* errorInvalidMove
* errorInvalidRegistration
* errorInvalidLogin

The following is a list of properties that should be filled in for each communication type.

## requestMoves

This communication type will be used to communicate to the server that a player wishes to move a piece to a certain position on the board. It will ultimately be up to the server to decide whether this move is valid or not. 

```javascript
{
  "communicationType": "requestMoves",
  "communicationVersion": 1,
  "matchID": "",
  "playerName": "",
  "pieceID": "C",
  "desiredMoves": []
}
```

* Player 1's pieces
   * g: Giraffe
   * m: Monkey
   * e: Elephant
   * l: Lion
   * c: Crocodile
   * z: Zebra
   * p: Pawn
* Player 2's pieces
   * G: Giraffe
   * M: Monkey
   * E: Elephant
   * L: Lion
   * C: Crocodile
   * Z: Zebra
   * P: Pawn
     
* `desiredMoves` will be a 1D array with the coordinates of the squares or positions on the board that the player would like to move to for their turn. The [row,column] coordinates of each square will be combined to for a single 2 digit number.  Thus the square [2,3] would be stored in the array as 23.  
The first value in the array must be the current location of the piece.  The next value in the array is the square the player wishes to move to.  So, desiredMoves[23,12] indicates the piece is currently at [2,3] and wishes to move to [1,2].  A monkey can indicate a sequence of jumps as follows:  [01,23,05].

## errorInvalidMove

This communication type will be sent by the server to a client after the server has determined that a requested move from the client is invalid. This will then indicate that the client must pick a different spot to move to.
