## Retrospective/Lessons Learned
- What did we do well?
  - Used the Kanban board to more equitably and efficiently assign tasks.
  - Communication across the group was clear and prompt.
  - Better focus on the high priority items.  
  - Broaden everybody responsibilities within the code base to give them more exposure to different features, languages, tools, etc.
  - Start early and spread out the delivery of our tasks.
- What should we have started doing in order to improve?
  - There’s still room for improvement in spreading out the work.
  - Also we could have better understood the blockages and schedule dependencies on others when assigning tasks.
  - Could meet with the product owner more often to make sure we’re delivering the product correctly but scheduling in academia is difficult.
  - Better planning to provide clarity and consistency on our communication formats between client and server.
- What did we learn?  
  - How to start a new project from a high level specification.  
  - How to research and select techniques, languages and tools to use to complete the project.
  - How to work and negotiate with others to arrive at a consensus.
