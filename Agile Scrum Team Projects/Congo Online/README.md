# Congo Online

- This project was developed over the course of a semester for my Object Oriented Design course. As a team, 
we developed this application using the agile scrum methodology. Sprints were every two weeks.

- This is a client-server application that allows users to play the chess variant "Congo" against eachother.
Users can create accounts, search for eachother, send eachother game invitations, start matches, and manage multiple games among other functionality.

- The client is built primarily in JavaScript using the React framework.
The server is built using Java WebSocket Server and Maven to manage dependencies and building with unit testing.
Persisent data is stored in a MySQL database connected to the server.

- The client and server communicate via WebSocket using JSON messages.

- During development GitHub was used for source control as well as CI and accessing user stories.

- Travis CI was the platform that was used for CI.

- During development I worked on the full stack including the client, server, APIs, and database.

- Source code can be found primarily in the "client" and "server" folders.
