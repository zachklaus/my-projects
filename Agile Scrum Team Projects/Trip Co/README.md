# Trip Co

- This project was developed over the course of a semester for my Software Engineering course. As a team of four, 
we developed this application using the agile scrum methodology. Sprints were every two weeks.

- This is a client-server application that allows the user to plan an itinerary for visiting various types of destinations among other functionality.

- The client is built primarily in JavaScript using the React framework.
The server is built using Java Spark and Maven to manage dependencies and building with unit testing.

- The client and server communicate via REST API using JSON messages.

- During development GitHub was used for source control as well as CI and accessing user stories.

- Travis was the platform that was used for CI.

- During development I worked on the full stack including the client, server, and APIs.

- Source code can be found primarily in the "client" and "server" folders.
